# Hi, I'm Sanjay.

I build end-to-end analytics systems - clean data in, dashboards and decisions out. Most of my work sits at the intersection of BI (Power BI), analytics engineering (SQL + Python), and applied ML when it adds real value.

If you only click two things: start with **Supply Chain Analytics** (Azure + Power BI) and **MovieLens** (deployed Streamlit).

- Supply Chain Disruption Analytics - Azure to Power BI pipeline, KPI monitoring, stats + delay risk modeling ([Repo](https://www.github.com/sanjay-dilip/supply-chain-disruption-analytics))
- MovieLens Recommender - ALS + hybrid ranking, deployed Streamlit app ([Repo](https://github.com/sanjay-dilip/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/movielens-recommender))
- Letterboxd Sentiment API - weak labels + NLP model, FastAPI service ([Repo](https://www.github.com/sanjay-dilip/letterboxd-sentiment-api))
- Sim2Real Engagement - sim vs real churn signals, Streamlit comparison dashboard ([Repo](https://github.com/sanjay-dilip/sim2real-engagement))

## What I work on
- DA/BI: Power BI (DAX), Tableau, KPI reporting, dashboard storytelling
- Analytics: SQL, Python (pandas), experimentation, forecasting
- Data Engineering: ETL/ELT, curated layers (Parquet), data modeling, quality checks
- ML (supporting): NLP, recommenders/ranking, model evaluation, deployment (FastAPI)

## Highlights
- I like projects where metrics tie to real decisions (late delivery risk, churn risk, ranking quality).
- I care about reproducibility: clear READMEs, runnable steps, and basic checks.

## Current Focus
- Shipping more BI artifacts: dashboard screenshots, KPI definitions, and DAX notes
- Strengthening data engineering habits: curated layers, data checks, and clean project structure
- Improving project READMEs: clearer results, visuals, and 3-step run instructions
- Adding lightweight automation: GitHub Actions for linting/tests and sanity checks

## Tools I use
SQL, Power BI, Excel, Python (pandas, scikit-learn), Streamlit, FastAPI, Snowflake, Azure (ADF/Blob), GitHub Actions

Outside of work, I like exploring media datasets and building analytics around user behavior.
